            <h2>Theoretical Poet in Chemistry</h2>
            <p>A good day to you, indeed. Thank you for stumbling upon the musings of a chemist who finds poetry in molecular orbitals and elegance in the dance of electrons. My name is <strong>Monica</strong>, and my journey through the vast expanse of theoretical and quantum chemistry has been guided by two principlesâ€”symmetry, and the works from the founding fathers of quantum mechanics.</p>

            <p>For years, I have honed my craft in <strong>Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations</strong>, peering into the unseen world of molecular interactions and reaction mechanisms. To me, chemistry is more than equations and numbersâ€”itâ€™s the language of nature, a grand symphony of energy, structure, and motion, waiting to be deciphered.</p>

            <h2>Beyond Research</h2>
            <p>Beyond research, I have had the privilege of teaching <strong>General Chemistry, Organic Chemistry, Calculus, and Classical Physics</strong> to students from all walks of life. While my primary students were undergraduates, some of my fondest memories come from outreach programs:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>âœ¨ <em>Cal Polyâ€™s Learn by Doing Program</em> - Demonstrating the magic of conductivity to middle schoolers.</li>
                <li>ðŸ”¬ <em>Girls Power Day (Toledo, OH - Imagination Station)</em> - Introducing young minds to the wonders of laser photophysics.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Witnessing curiosity ignite in a studentâ€™s eyes is a reminder of why I fell in love with the field myself.</p>

        <section class="wanderer">
            <h2>Wanderer of Lands & Minds</h2>
            <p>I was born and raised in <strong>Tokyo, Japan</strong>, a city of neon and tradition, where I lived until I was 14. Since then, my path has taken me across continents and coastsâ€”from <strong>San Jose, California</strong>, where I graduated from Gunderson High School, to <strong>San Luis Obispo</strong>, where I earned my <strong>AS in Mathematics at Cuesta College</strong> and <strong>BS in Chemistry at Cal Poly</strong>. Now, I am completing my <strong>Masterâ€™s in Chemistry at Bowling Green State University</strong>, conducting DFT calculations for my lab and collaborating groups.</p>

            <p>There was even a brief chapter in <strong>New York City</strong>, a year etched in memory when <em>War Horse</em> and <em>The Book of Mormon</em> dominated Broadway, and the city pulsed with an energy that was both overwhelming and electrifying.</p>

        <section class="outdoors">
            <h2>Between Science & the Outdoors</h2>
            <p>While my work dwells in the quantum realm, my soul has learned to love the outdoors. <strong>Roller skating</strong> has been a part of my life since I was sixâ€”a pastime that feels like true ecstasy. <strong>Hiking and sitting by the ocean</strong> bring a deep sense of peace, though these days, I live far from both.</p>

            <p>Still, I dream of the <strong>Pacific blue at twilight</strong>, between Monterey Bay and Santa Barbaraâ€”that fleeting shade of color just after sunset, the most beautiful thing I have ever seen. If I could, Iâ€™d share that moment with every human on Earth, just once, to remind them of the quiet entrancing beauty the world has to offer.</p>

        <section class="art-mind">
            <h2>A Mind Between Science & Art</h2>
            <p>In my teenage years, <strong>books and music</strong> became my refuge, and through the years, my love for them has only deepened. Romanticism, with its raw emotion and untamed imagination, found its way into my heart during my college years, and <strong>Fyodor Dostoevsky</strong>, whom I finally pushed myself to read when life was sour, truly helped shape how I see and absorb the world around me.</p>

            <p>Whether in literature, film, or music, I am drawn to works crafted with complexity and open-ended interpretationâ€”<strong>art that does not confine itself but expands into the vastness of human thought</strong>.</p>

        <section class="closing">
            <p>If youâ€™ve read this far, then perhaps we are kindred spiritsâ€”seekers of knowledge, lovers of beauty, wanderers of both the physical and intellectual world. Whatever brought you here, I hope you leave with a spark of curiosity and a little more wonder than before.</p>

            <p>And if nothing else, I hope today is kind to you.</p>
